        What should come first, houses or museums? Everything at once: the houses, the schools, the
museums, the libraries. Urban Planning cannot ignore cultural issues. If in the construction of new
neighbourhoods, new housing forms the basis of the city plan (and by housing we also mean the market,
the schools and the public services like the hospital and the post offices), the planning of a city cannot
overlook two key public buildings that still today are considered an intellectual luxury: the Museum and
the Library.
